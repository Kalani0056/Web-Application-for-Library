                        <p> should you move on to the thesis. The thesis should be a clear, 
                            one-sentence explanation of your position that leaves no doubt in 
                            the reader’s mind about which side you are on from the beginning of 
                            your essay.

                            Following the thesis, you should provide a mini-outline which previews
                             the examples you will use to support your thesis in the rest of the essay. 
                             Not only does this tell the reader what to expect in the paragraphs to come
                              but it also gives them a clearer understanding of what the essay is about.
                            
                            Finally, designing the last sentence in this way has the added benefit of 
                            seamlessly moving the reader to the first paragraph of the body of the paper. 
                            In this way we can see that the basic introduction does not need to be much more 
                            than three or four sentences in length. If yours is much longer you might want to
